# Mock API Example

This is an example Mock API for rapid front-end development. I walk through how to build this from scratch in [Building a JavaScript Development Environment](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/cory-house) on Pluralsight.

## Quick Start

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Load http://localhost:3001/users

## Next Steps

Generate PUT, POST, and DELETE requests against the mock API and note that changes are saved to db.json, so they're reflected on refresh like a real database exists! To see this in action, check out [Building a JavaScript Development Environment](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/cory-house) on Pluralsight.
